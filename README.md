### ‚ú® What I'm currently focused on:
* Currently working in a **LoRa-based water quality monitoring station**.
* **Advancing IoT solutions** with robust LoRa communication.
* Exploring new paradigms in **firmware development** for embedded systems.
* Deepening my knowledge in **web development** to build impactful applications.
* Leveraging **data science** to extract insights from complex datasets.

---

### üìö My Latest Contribution:

* In collaboration with my colleagues, I contributed to this publication for the SBESC symposium: **[IEEEXplore article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771930)** - This work aims to develop an algorithm that is able to determine the location of a moving object based on its angular position, the results show that the angle-based algorithm reduces the number of transmitted coordinates by up to 30%.

### üí° Beyond the Code: My Interests

* I have some experience in **3D modeling and 3D printing**, often leveraging these skills for prototyping and developing custom enclosures for my embedded systems projects.
* In my free time, I enjoy producing music in **Digital Audio Workstations (DAW)**, exploring different sounds and genres.
